An abstract class is a class declared as abstract and used as a superclass in 
a hierarchy of classes. 
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

An abstract class may or may not include abstract methods. 
If an abstract class includes abstract methods, those methods must be in the 
implemented in the concrete (non-abstract) subclasses. 
Abstract classes can have abstract subclasses that don't need to include the 
abstract methods.

Only the abstract method declaration is in the abstract class. 
Abstract methods are instance methods with the abstract keyword in the 
declaration.
There is no implementation of the abstract method in the abstract class.

Abstract methods can only be declared in abstract classes.

The purpose of an abstract class is to be extended.
It provides a superclass from which other classes can inherit and share a
common design.
You never intend to create objects of the abstract class because it is 
general and incomplete. 
Abstract classes only specify what is common in the subclasses.

An example of an abstract class is:
